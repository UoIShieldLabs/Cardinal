"""Directory search -- the SQLi anchor, reflected-XSS sink, and the surface we
use to demonstrate SERVER-SIDE defenses (Tiers 1-3) and the documented attacks
that bypass them.

Toggles (all per request):
  ?impl=concat|param|proc   SQL path (proc = stored-procedure dynamic SQL, Tier 2)
  ?serversan=denylist|escape|allowlist   server-side input sanitization (Tier 1)
  ?id=<expr>                numeric-context filter (Tier 1 escape blind spot)
  ?sort=<col>               ORDER BY identifier, concatenated (Tier 2 param hole)
